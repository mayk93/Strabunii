A square tile is made out of two triangles.
We define a triangle as a collection of 3 integers,
representing the  index of the three vertices that describe them.
We define "triangles" (the variable) as an array of 6 elements.
We use 6, as in 6 = 2*3 integers to represent the fact a tile is
made out of 2 triangles, each triangle being made out of 3 vertices.

    0 ----- 1
    | \  B  |
    |   \   |
    | A   \ |
    2 ----- 3

    The tile is made from triangles A and B.
    Triangle A is defined as the vertices [0,3,2]
    Triangle A is defined as the vertices [0,1,3]
    As a rule of thumb, we start the notations clockwise ( for the triangle )
    It is important to keep track of the order because the renderer
    might display them "wrong" ( the mesh could be visible on the side
    opposite to the camera ).
